#Teema
Just write. The ultimate distraction free text editor.

*This is a work in progress.*

##Master rule
All rules must support the ultimate goal of text **creation**.

##Rule n.1
Absolutely **no** choices for the user.

- One font
- One size of a letter
- One length of a row
- One window size
- One save location
- No toolbars
- No dialogs
- Only thing you see is words
- Only thing you can do is typing.

###The font
[Monospace](https://ia.net/writer/blog/writer-pro/)

###Size of a letter
This depends on three things. Screen resolution, screen size and the distance of the reader. All of these are more or less variables. We probably can decide the ratio of hight to the distance of the reader. The we just have to identify the device.

###Length of a row
66-character line. [SOURCE](https://thedesignteam.io/the-type-snob-f221969a884b)

###Save location
Desktop is easy to find and works as a natural middle point in a workflow.

###Window size
Full screen. You should not be looking anything else.

##FAQ

###Why is there no spell checking
You should not be thinking about the spelling when you are creating something new. Spell correction is for the editing phase.

###Why can I not change X
I don't want you to think what you want to change. I want you to think what you want to say.

###Heading, list and making things bold are important part of my workflow.
Please consider using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It is much more quicker than heading dialogs and toolbars.
